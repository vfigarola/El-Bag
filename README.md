# Project Overview
Laboratory studies of attention often utilize anechoic listening conditions that do not reflect the acoustic complexity of real-world acoustic settings. Naturalistic listening environments often include reverberation, which distorts sound localization cues by smearing out acoustic features and decorrelating the information that enters the ears. While past research primarily focused on reverberation’s impact on behavioral performance, such as speech reception thresholds (SRT), we suggest that spatial attention may also operate differently in reverberant environments.

<b> Experiment 1 (Online Study) </b> evaluates reverberation’s effect on selective spatial attention using behavioral measures, while expanding on previous work on interrupting sounds and spatial attention (Liang et al, 2022).

<b> Experiment 2 </b> uses pupillometry to study how reverberation impacts listening effort and track microsaccade suppression to index the salience of bottom-up interruptions during a spatial attention task, similar to Experiment 1
